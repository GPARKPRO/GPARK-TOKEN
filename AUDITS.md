# GParkToken Security Audits

## 🛡️ Purpose

This document tracks the security audits and code reviews for the `GParkToken` smart contract.

We believe in strong security guarantees and full transparency for our community and future users. The contract is built using OpenZeppelin audited libraries and will undergo independent audits as the project evolves.

## ✅ Current Audit Status

| Date | Auditor | Report Link | Notes                                             |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| -    | -       | -           | GParkToken smart contract pending external audit. |

## 🔎 Audit Goals

1. Confirm the absence of backdoors or admin override functions.
2. Ensure correct implementation of ERC20, ERC20Votes, ERC20Permit standards.
3. Validate the correctness of the vesting mechanism.
4. Confirm protection against known attack vectors (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflows).

## 📝 Independent Audits Roadmap

The following steps are planned:

1. Internal code review by Global Park DAO contributors.
2. Bug bounty program launch (planned).
3. Commissioning of external security audits from reputable auditing firms.
